# Accessibility Monitor - Information Systems Project

This project was a collaborative effort involving two more students for our ``` Information Systems Project``` subject.

This project consists of an accessibility monitor, a ```full-stack``` app, that allows you to evaluate the webpages of a website based on the accessibility criteria tested by the library [QualWeb](https://qualweb.di.fc.ul.pt/evaluator/).

Implemented with ```Angular```, ```Express```, and ```MongoDB```.

## Run

To run, you just need to execute the ```run.sh``` command, which will run the application with Docker.

Forntend runs on port ```3069``` and the backend on ```3019```.
